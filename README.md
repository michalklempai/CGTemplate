# CGTemplate
General project template for any computer graphics software (computer game, renderer, 3D graphics, etc.). It is template for Visual C++.

It contains support for:
- Bezier curves and surfaces
- NURBS curves and surfaces
- BSP (binary space partitioning) trees
- Matrix operations (inversion, transpose, determinat, shear, scale, project, etc.)
- Texture operations (load/save TGA, interpolation, gaussian blur, line rasterization, etc.)
- CIE XYZ 1931 table
- general Point (i.e. x,y,z vertex for example) and intersection operations (like line-line, point-plane, etc.)
- Vector (length, normalization, cross, dot product, reflection and refraction vector, spherical coordinates, lightprobe coordinates, etc.)
- Vertex class
- Ray class
- Plane class
- general Face (i.e. triangle for example) and a lot of intersection operations (like face-plane, triangle-ray, face-edge, face-oobbox, etc.)
- general Edge class
- Map class to work with textures
- HDR image operations (load/save HDR image, load to OpenGL, summed area table calculation, etc.)
- Covex Hull (quick hull 2D and 3D alghorithm)
- Color conversions and operations (hermite and cubic Bezier interpolation, RGB->HSV, HSV->RGB, RGB->spectrum and back, etc.)
- operations to work with ASE files (you can get some from 3D Studio MAX)
- Primitive 3D objects (like sphere, disc, cone, cylinder, paraboloid, torus, etc.)
- Axis aligned boundary box (point, ray, plane, aabbox intersections)
- Object oriented boundary box (point, ray, plane, aabbox, oobbox intersections)
- Bounding sphere (point, ray, plane, aabbox, oobbox, bsphere intersections)
- Scene class to work with complex scenes
- Object class to work with scene objects (reset xform, find bounding box, etc.)
- Homogenous coordinates class
- Complex number class
- Complex index of refraction calculation
- Quaternions (slerp, inverse, conjaguate, etc.)
- Camera operations (roll, pitch, slide, yaw)
- Light class (ambient, point, directional, omnidirectional, hdr image light source, etc.)
- Material properties (like bump, transparency, shininess, etc.)
- Math constants (PI, Euler number, etc.)
